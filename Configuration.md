# Configuration #

This program doesn't deal with the configuration of the card. If your running Windows or Mac OS X, you can use the tools provided by Eye-Fi. If you are running Linux, you may want to use [eyefi-config](http://code.google.com/p/eyefi-config/) the tools created by Dave Hansen.

The program needs an XML files such as those generated by the Eye-Fi Manager. Here is an example of such a file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<Config version="2.0">
    <ShowThumbnailPreview>true</ShowThumbnailPreview>
    <MIB>
        <ReceivedCounter>0</ReceivedCounter>
    </MIB>
    <Cards>
        <Card MacAddress="00-18-56-41-77-29">
            <UploadKey>0d6ec517a597ec130b64e77c9b57f40e</UploadKey>
            <DownsyncKey>693db4cdaa431bb3b1132dfe89c60755</DownsyncKey>
            <TransferMode>2</TransferMode>
            <TransferModeTimestamp>1304088542</TransferModeTimestamp>
            <MediaTypes>
                <Media Type="1">
                    <Folder>/Users/maurice/Pictures/Eye-Fi</Folder>
                    <AddDate>1</AddDate>
                    <DateType>1</DateType>
                    <CustomDateFormat></CustomDateFormat>
                </Media>
                <Media Type="2">
                    <Folder>/Users/maurice/Movies/Eye-Fi</Folder>
                    <AddDate>1</AddDate>
                    <DateType>0</DateType>
                    <CustomDateFormat></CustomDateFormat>
                </Media>
                <Media Type="4">
                    <Folder>/Users/maurice/Pictures/Eye-Fi/Raw</Folder>
                    <AddDate>1</AddDate>
                    <DateType>1</DateType>
                    <CustomDateFormat></CustomDateFormat>
                </Media>
            </MediaTypes>
        </Card>
    </Cards>
</Config>
```

The configuration file can be passed as a command-line argument to sceye-fi; if no argument is passed, it tries to open:

  * **user-home**`/Application Data/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml`
  * **user-home**`/Library/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml`

These are the files that the Eye-Fi Manager creates respectively on Windows, and on Mac.

The `UploadKey` is an important piece of information: it's a secret shared between an Eye-Fi card and the server. They use it to authenticate one another.

I have identified three types of media so far:

  * Photos (Type 1)
  * Movies (Type 2)
  * Raw photos (Type 4)

They relate to the Photos, RAW, Video tabs in the Eye-Fi Center application, in the Eye-Fi card settings.
